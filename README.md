## Project Overview
**Auth-Monitor Security Notification System** is an Ubuntu-based real-time automated authentication logs monitoring and notification system. It is designed to enhance server security by providing:
- Real-time alerts.
- Detailed monitoring of authentication events.
- Automated processes for timely notifications and efficient management of remote connections.

---

### **Introduction**
The Auth-Monitor Security Notification System addresses the shortcomings of traditional logging methods. By introducing real-time log monitoring and automated notifications, the system ensures timely responses to authentication events and improves overall server security.

### **Current System**
The existing methods for monitoring server authentication logs involve significant limitations:
- **Manual Log Checking:** Delays in identifying potential breaches.
- **No Real-Time Analysis:** Hindering swift responses to unauthorized access.
- **Lack of Automation:** Increasing the risk of overlooking critical incidents.
- **Time-Consuming and Error-Prone:** Reliance on human monitoring can lead to missed events.

#### **Problems Faced:**
- Lack of Real-Time Notifications
- Lack of Automation
- Limited Data Analysis
- High Risk of Human Error
- Slow Response to Incidents

### **Proposed System**
The proposed system introduces a range of features to improve security and monitoring efficiency:
- **Real-Time Log Analysis:** Continuously monitors authentication logs for suspicious activities.
- **Automated Notifications:** Alerts administrators instantly about significant events.
- **Centralized Log Management:** Unified interface for managing logs from multiple servers.
- **Customizable Alert Thresholds:** Enables tailored monitoring based on event severity.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Designed for growth across multiple servers.
- **Detailed Reports and Audit Trails:** Ensures compliance and aids forensic investigations.

#### **Key Features:**
- Alerts about different SSH connections.
- Automatic log parsing for pattern detection and anomaly identification.
- Scalable design for evolving organizational needs.
- Supports tailored alert thresholds for efficient security management.
